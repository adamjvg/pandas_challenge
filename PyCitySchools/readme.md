### Observable Trends from finalised PyCity Schools data

There are a few trends apparent in this data after analysing it. 
Firstly, how much a school invests per student is not reflected in the overall passing percentage. In fact, it seems the more you invest in a child, the lower the scores. The lowest two categories of investment have much higher passing rates than the wealthier schools, as well as achieving much higher maths and reading grades on average. The school with the highest overall pass rate fell into the lower spend per student category. 

We can also glean from this data that larger schools have a lower passing rate than medium or smaller schools. Schools with between 1000 to 2000 students were the best performing. The worst 5 performing schools all fell into the largest category of school size.
The data also suggests that students will do better significantly better in a charter school over a district school, with the former having over 20% more students maths and reading.

One thing that is important to note is that this analysis does not include a comparison of size versus budget per student. This analysis could reveal whether the size or the budget has a bigger impact on a students passing rate. But what we can tell is that students are statistically more likely to do better if they attend a medium sized  Charter school that spends between $600 to $650 on each student.
